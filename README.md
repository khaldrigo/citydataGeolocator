First screen, by this first commit it only has a initial Text widget and two IconButtons, the first one tracks location in real time, the second one, tracks your static location.

While i didn't started setting my map yet, the print screen isn't too useful, because the returned data are strings of coordinates, but this repository will be constantly updated while i do increments.

The app also has snackbars to track errors depending on user permissions or location not enabled.
